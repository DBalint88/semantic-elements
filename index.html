      <h1>15 HTML Elements (6/15)</h1>
      <p>Semantic elements in HTML consist of any element whose tag describes its function. This is in contrast to non-semantic elements such as div.  The point is that they not only tell the browser how to render the content, but also describe to anyone reading the code what it is they're looking at. (7/15)</p>
      <h2>And now, a description of my last week at school! (8/15)</h2>
      <p>The last week of school was busy this year.  The district went full online-learning, and teachers, parents, and children alike were forced to adapt.  I was fortunate to have my Ruby to help me through.</p>

      <p>I started out the quarantine by producing an all-audio virtual chorus with the kids.  I sent them demo tracks to sing along with in their headphones while they recorded themselves singing.  Then they submitted the recording of just their voice back to me, and I layered it in GarageBand into a choir.  Here's one song we did:</p>

        <source src="circle-of-life.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Your browser does not support the audio tag.
      </audio> <!-- 12/15 -->
      <p>I posted it to the school's twitter.  Even though there was some nice feedback, the audio didn't grab people's attention. People need a visual.  I had to face the facts that if my chorus kids were going to make an impression on their community during the pandemic, they needed a video.  So I set to work.  </p>
      <p>I downloaded a new audio workstation and a video editor and taught the kids to use <a href:"https://flipgrid.com/">Flipgrid</a> (13/15), and after a lot of work on everyone's part, I found myself on the last week of school putting the finishing touches on our video, which I hope you'll enjoy:</p>
